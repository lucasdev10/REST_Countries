## Presentation about the challenge:

## Brief
### Your challenge is to integrate with the REST Countries API to pull country data and display it like in the designs.

### You can use any JavaScript framework/library on the front-end such as React or Vue. You also have complete control over which packages you use to do things like make HTTP requests or style your project.

### Your users should be able to:

#### See all countries from the API on the homepage
#### Search for a country using an input field
#### Filter countries by region
#### Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
#### Click through to the border countries on the detail page
#### Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode (optional)

### Download the starter code and go through the README.md file. This will provide further details about the project. The style-guide.md file is where you'll find colors, fonts, etc.

## Getting started
#### Download the starter code

#### Choose a JS framework/library and create your project

#### Set up the project with version control (e.g. Git)

#### Read the README.md file and have a look around the starter files

#### Get colors, fonts etc from the style-guide.md file

#### Set up your project/file architecture however you want

#### Start coding!

## Ideas to test yourself
#### Write your styles using a pre-processor, such as Sass, Less, Stylus or use a CSS-in-JS solution, like Styled Components

#### Try using Flexbox and Grid for layout

#### Practice working in a team by building with friends
